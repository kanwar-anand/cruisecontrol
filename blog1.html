								<h2>5 Reasons Commuters are Bored with Radio</h2>
								<span class="byline">Chris Hann | 17July2017</span>

							<p>Commuters are bored of radio. The age-old, go-to option of in-car entertainment is dying as
								commuters are increasingly looking to more productive ways of spending that morning and
								evening commute. This blog post explores 5 reasons why commuters are leaving radio due
								to boredom:
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>1. Bad, bad games</strong>
									<p>You know the games we’re talking about..listen to this poorly recorded sound for half a
										second and guess what is is. After all, who doesn’t know the difference between the
										sound of someone crumpling paper, reaching into a bag of chips, or turning the page of
										a newspaper.</p>
									</li>
									<li><strong>2. Idiotic callers</strong>
									<p>The guy calls in to play a classic gambler’s game, take the money or take another
										chance at winning more. It seems the only people that call in for these games have no
										concept of strategy or goals. Come on people, go in with a number in mind of what you
										want to achieve, it saves us having to listen to you agonize over the same decision over
										and over again.</p>
										<p>Then there’s the callers into political talk shows. Not only does Johnny have no idea of
										the complexities of US-North Korea relations, he also seems to think dropping a nuclear
										bomb is the first thing a President should do to a whole nation of deprived and innocent
										civilians.</p>
									</li>
									<li><strong>3. No balance between music, intelligence, and sport</strong>
									<p>If you’re like me, you have your 3 presets programmed into your radio:</p>
										<p>1. There’s your music station with genre of choice, be it pop, country, rock, or
										classical.</p>
										<p>2. You have your talk radio station when you’re feeling in the mood to engage
										your brain on the commute to or from work.</p>
										<p>3. Then there’s your sports station where you get to the most opinionated of all
										radio hosts go over the big plays or trades from the night before.</p>
									<p>The question is this: where is the <a href="http://www.nbc.com/">NBC</a> version of radio stations, a one-stop shop for all
										your entertainment needs? Everything in moderation would save a lot of preset button
										pressing to fulfil your itch for the other interests in your life.</p>

									</li>
									<li><strong>4. Same songs over, and over, and over again</strong>
									<p>Did you hear that Ed Sheeran / Adele / Rascal Flatts have new singles out? Of course
										you have! Why? Because your music radio station kindly played it for you once on the
										way to work and once on the way home, every day for the last 6 weeks.</p>
										<p>You take that quick trip to the grocery store on the weekend, and what is playing but that
											same song…<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Sxv-sUYtM">Happy by Pharell Williams</a>...AGAIN! We can’t take any more Happy,
											Pharell…let’s be sad, anxious, angry, anything but that again.</p>
									</li>
									<li><strong>5. Commercials that belong in the ‘80s</strong>
									<p>If we were to get a copy of the guide to radio advertising as sent out by today’s radio
										stations to prospective advertisers, it would surely read like this:</p>
										<p>1. Go to your local library and check out the book published in 1983 by Edna
										Bloggs on how to produce a <em>hip</em> radio commercial</p>
										<p>2. Buy a microphone and a subscription to sounds with titles such as “crowd
										applause” and “crowd groans”</p>
										<p>3. Pick from your extensive 4-person staff to find out which one always wanted to
										be an actor but never followed their dream. Tell them they’re not talented enough
										and proceed to hire yourself for the role.</p>
										<p>4. Record 30 seconds of cheese that would convince only your mother to come
										purchase your services and goods</p>
									
									</li>
									<li><strong>Alternatives?</strong>
									<p>Commuters are bored of radio. That’s why they are increasingly turning to their own music
										playlists, podcasts, and even silent meditation. Commuters are not mere lemmings to be
										entertained, they are often successful, driven, young professionals who want nothing more
										than to turn the commute into productivity. This trend is giving rise to companies such as
										CruiseControl whose mission is to turn the daily commute productive time.</p>
