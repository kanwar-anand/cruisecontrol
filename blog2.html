								<h2>What Successful People Do On Their Commute</h2>
								<span class="byline">Emilija Makaji | 17July2017</span>
							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>I love my job but I spend at least 80 hours a month commuting. If you are anything
								like me, you may feel that the time spent commuting is not only stressful but also
								wasted. So why not do something about it?</p>
								
								<p>Here are 5 ways to be more productive on your commute:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>1. Set today’s goals</strong>
									<p>Successful people plan ahead. Before their day starts they set achievable goals.
These are SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timebound).
Their goals are short-term not only because it is easier to achieve them,
but because it gets them to their vision faster. </p>
<p>You can set SMART goals too and you don’t even need to wake up half an hour early
just to plan your day. Set your SMART goals during your commute to work. If you
can’t write a list because you are driving, there are some speech recognition
applications that will let you dictate and prioritize your to-do list while you drive.
On your drive home, the software can then read the list back to so you can review
all the things you have accomplished that day.</p>
									</li>
									<li><strong>2. Learn a language</strong>
									<p>It’s not surprising that successful people are so well-spoken and often speak
multiple languages - they take time to learn.</p>
										<p>You can use the time during your commute to learn a new language. Imagine the
boost this could add to your career. Try using the hands-free language application
by CruiseControl, it will let you not only listen to new vocabulary and phrases but it
will also record you when you speak back. The application will let you hear yourself
speaking and provide feedback so you can improve.
</p>
									</li>
									<li><strong>3. Listen to a podcast or audiobook</strong>
									<p>Successful people are always up to speed on the latest news and they make reading
a major part of their daily life. Warren Buffet once said that reading is the key to
success because it allows knowledge to build like compound interest.</p>
									<p>If you don’t have time to read during the day or after work, use the time you are
spending sitting in your car driving to “read” an audiobook or listen to a podcast.
Podcasts offered by The Great Courses and audiobooks will not only help prevent
stress, they will enhance your confidence and decision making skills.
</p>

									</li>
									<li><strong>4. Get things done</strong>
									<p>Prioritize and tackle the most important tasks. Successful people accomplish the
most urgent and critical tasks first. In an interview, former US President Obama
said that when there are too many decisions to make he strategizes his decisionmaking.
</p>
										<p>But the truth is the tasks on the bottom of our to-do list still need to get done -
things like training modules and certificate courses. So why not get them out of
the way early and have the rest of the day to focus on the high priority tasks. Just
like the most successful leaders, you can use your time strategically; CruiseControl
offers a great way to complete all your training via interactive audio modules while
you drive.
</p>
									</li>
									<li><strong>5. Turn your commute time into extra cash</strong>
									<p>Everyone has obstacles in their life but how successful people overcome them
determines their success. They are able to transform obstacles into opportunities. </p>
										<p>Transform the time you spend on the road driving and start earning extra money.
Use commute time to complete audio surveys or participate in focus groups. On
average, you can earn up to $100 for 30 minutes of your drive time. You can sign-up
for free on CruiseControl and turn your commute time into rewards. </p>
